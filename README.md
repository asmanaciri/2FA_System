# 2FA_System
Design and Implementation of a Two-Factor Authentication Web Server
This project implements a Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) system using PHP and MySQL. It provides an additional layer of security by requiring users to input a One-Time Password (OTP) after their initial login with a username and password. This 2FA mechanism can help safeguard sensitive data and improve security in web applications.  
 + **Note**: MailHog should be installed and running locally to view OTP emails without sending them through a real email provider.
